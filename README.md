# Breakout

**Breakout** is a simple implementation of the classic brick-game Breakout.

The game is implented in C# and using MonoGames (XNA) openGL implementation for the rendering. Other parts of the engine, such as the physics, are written from the ground up and a basic particle system is also implemented. The architecture of the engine is based on ECS (Entity-Component-System) and is separated from the implementation of the game.
